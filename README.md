# vimpracti
Linux command line utility to exercise Vim shortcuts

## TODO
- Make Getch accept KeyboardInterupt (ctrl+c) for early exit
- Make cleaner 'frontend'
    - Do not print output after keypress. Instead, save it and print everything after game.
    - Make some kind of alert for user that time is up before beginning another question.
